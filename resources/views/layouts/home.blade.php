                                Dear Student, Parents and Visitors,

                                Welcome to the Arab Open University (AOU) Egypt Branch. Since its inception in 2002, AOU’s mission has been to develop and disseminate knowledge, and build expertise  according to international quality standards without time or geographical barriers for the sake of contributing and preparing manpower for development needs, and to build science and knowledge society in

                                Prof. Abd ElHai Ebid Egypt Branch Director
                                Prof. Abd ElHai Ebid
                                Egypt Branch Director
                                the Arab countries. AOU- Egypt Branch stands true to this mission and is thriving, thanks to the contributions of our distinguished faculty, our dedicated staff and our diverse and ambitious student body.

                                The AOU-Egypt Branch is unique in granting graduates a dual degree: one from the Open University (OU) in the UK and the other from the AOU. The degree offered from the AOU is accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education, and validated by the Supreme Council of Egyptian Universities; thereby equivalent to those offered by the Egyptian universities.

                                With more than 28,000 students and 20,000 alumni across eight Arab countries, the Arab Open University strives to provide an innovative, professionally-focused and high-quality education for young and adult students at reasonable fees. Coursework is integrated, accessible and well-supported by a learning process that allows students to interact with their tutors and colleagues, while leveraging a self-learning platform built on the latest information and communication technologies. For example, the Learning Management System (LMS), adopted by the AOU, helps students to get their required activities and support material, upload their assignments, and know their continuous assessment results.

                                Beyond academics, our students thrive in a multitude of extracurricular activities and community engagements. Whether it’s organizing community service events like blood donation campaigns, orphan and handicapped-support efforts or directing and performing our annual play, these activities provide an essential aspect of our students’ development and prepare them to tackle our society’s challenges.

                                Finally, I want to draw attention to our rapidly growing career development and planning services and the increasing profile of AOU-Egypt Branch among recruiters. We recently hosted our 3rd Annual Employment Fair and continue to attract more employers and develop our professional alumni networks. I also want to pay tribute to AOU-Egypt Branch’s recent graduates. As they venture out in the professional world and pursue dynamic and rewarding careers, I hope that they continue to embody the values of curiosity, critical thinking and dedication that form the essence of their time at AOU.

                                I look forward to seeing you on campus. I am glad to have you as part of our AOU family.

                                Sincerely,


                            </p>
